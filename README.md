Fellow seeker of interactive wonders! My name is Tim Moth and I'm a multispecialist, promoter, community-builder and a creative dabbling in a variety of interactive fields.

Another me moves off with the camera and whispers
While we let him do his thing I wanted to share a deeper insight about what this is all about.
My path of discovery has been a long one. 
Over the years I went from my initial background in photography 
rapid slideshow of photos on a Big Cardboard stand
and writing 
stacks of pages and notes with the Big Cardboard background covering it all
through filmmaking to interactive videoart 
dreemrelm 
and finally development of interactive experiences. 
seafarer wallows 
During that time I got to know two things about myself: 
I want to quietly nurture and grow unique worlds for people to experience.
I want to gather like-minded individuals to create communities of learners and educators in the art of virtual interaction.
And that’s what Cyberhippie’s aim is…

Back to the the main…

We provide and give you access to:
a 100+ strong vibrant online space, a safe haven for getting to know other enthusiasts and creatives from various fields, 
regular Cyberhippie HQ broadcasts and community gatherings and discussions on Twitch and Discord, 
on-demand 24/7 services based on our in-house and community expertise 
and a variety of Patron-only perks

But why here? Why Patreon? 
We’ve been developing Cyberhippie Collective as a free for all experience since 2013 and we are ready to make it a full-time endeavour. The truth is that we need to be able to provide for our families as we engage the community, make games and organize quality events. 
[All funds received go towards in-house development, high-speed internet, website hosting, promotion and essential life expenses SLIDESHOW]

That’s where Patreon comes in. It allows you to pledge a monthly payment to creators so they can keep making things. Such independent process gives space for unbiased creative freedom and a direct way for the Patrons to influence creator's decisions. 
That’s the value we want to give you above all other perks - to have a creative stake in what we do, to give you the opportunity to turn Cyberhippie HQ into an inspiring online makerspace you want it to be, with proper tech and decor to make the community feel at home and nurtured.
Thank you so much for dropping by!



After all who knows perhaps one day it will become a physical space!?

[ ] Promotion Tips: Make sure you have one patron only post.
Get familiar with the creator dashboard.
Switch your patreon banner on all social media.
Add a link to your Patreon to your email signature
Embed Patreon button on the website.
Ask your friends to spread the word.
Ask other Patreon creators to share your launch.
Send out an email to your subscribers.
If you’ve got an email list, send out the email announcing your launch!
Host a live stream - The planning for this is best done during the pre-launch, so now’s the time to reap the benefits. Host a live stream on Launch day to welcome your friends to your new Patreon page. Encourage them to follow you even if they don’t become your patrons.
Host a real life launch party.

Celebrate in real life with your friends! The bigger and more exciting this feels to your friends, the more excited they’ll be for you and the more they’ll rave about it to others. Plus, you did a lot of work, so you deserve a celebration. Take a moment to relish it because there’s plenty more work to come.

Get press!

Contact blogs that are related to your work and see if they’d be willing to do a story about your page. A lot of people use this technique with great success.

Create more than three free posts during the first month.

Keeping your followers and patrons engaged is a big part of building your Patreon community so make sure you’re posting plenty of free posts and updates about your projects. Communicate with your supporters as much as possible without spamming them or constantly promoting yourself. Be genuine.

Send messages.

Send messages to people when they become your Patrons to thank them! Staying engaged and personal with your supporters is what Patreon is all about.

Poll your patrons for reward ideas.

A great idea for free content that also helps you is to start a poll on Patreon to find out what kinds of rewards excite your patrons.

Give progress peaks for your upcoming projects.

Another great way to stay engaged between releases is to update your fans with progress about your upcoming projects. This kind of insider knowledge is part of what makes it exciting to support artists.

Submit to get featured.

When your page is looking good and you’re being super active and engaged, submit your page to be featured on Patreon Discovery so people outside of your community can find you.

Manage your expectations and stick with it.

Especially if you’re coming to Patreon without an established fan-base, the going can seem really slow at first. If you’re growth is slow, just keep at it. Keep engaging, keep promoting, and don’t give up. Then see where you’re at in a year.

All the video examples above have one key thing in common — they clearly tell viewers how their funds will help create more of the content they love.
By the time someone gets to a Patreon page, they’ve usually consumed a fair bit of the creator’s content already, so we can presume they like it. So this video isn’t about selling — it’s about showcasing the value viewers will get.
There are some extra steps you can take to make your video irresistible.
Tell us a bit more about you: Briefly tell the viewers who you are and what you do.
Tell us how the money will be spent: Be clear (and realistic) about what the funds will be going toward. The best relationships between creators and patrons are built on trust and honesty.
Keep it snappy: Get to the point quickly and keep it simple.
Direct users to the copy underneath the video: You don’t have to cover everything in the video — get the main points across, then tell viewers where they can learn more.
Be clear about any rewards: Tell supporters what they’re going to get from supporting you and walk them through the different perks.
Be yourself: This is the most important (and sometimes hardest) part. Your audience want to support you because they like what you do. Let your personality come through in the video or you’ll lose them.

[ ] CAMPAIGN DESCRIPTION

Fellow seeker of interactive wonders! We are a live collaborative workspace for game makers and lovers, joyful indie game studioand an event venue. Think of us as a materialised need to discover, grow and nurture unique digital experiences as well as a united community dedicated to enabling you to express your passions.
Join us and become a game creator and enthusiast you always wanted to be deep down in your heart. Take part in creation of interactive beauty for yourself and others to enjoy while helping a multitude of aspiring makers like you to learn and grow.
So long story short, we provide and give you an exclusive access to:
	•	a vibrant online workspace that will be your safe haven for getting to know other enthusiasts and creatives from a variety of fields ready to give you their feedback. We believe exchange of ideas and skills is crucial for the growth of the medium and enables innovative discussion on the cultural development of games,
	•	regular Cyberhippie HQ broadcasts and community gatherings including creative workshops, live exhibits, game development and training sessions, discussion panels, game jams, game nights and tournaments,
	•	on-demand 24/7 services including but not limited to creative consulting, testing, translation and promotion based on our in-house and community expertise.

As we learned over the years it usually takes a push and some positive reinforcement to begin your journey. We want to be that one thing that makes you reach for your vision and make it a reality.

What is Patreon?
Patreon is a platform allowing you to pledge a monthly payment to creators so they can keep making things. Using Patreon is far more favourable than traditional ways of promotion and seeking funding.

It makes the process entirely independent, allowing for full unbiased creative freedom and a direct way for the viewers to influence creator's decisions.

Why do you need the money?
We have been developing Cyberhippie Collective since 2013 and we are finally ready to make it a full-time endeavour by making it our main source of income. The hard truth is that we need to be able to provide for our families in exchange for the invested time dedicated to running the community, making games and organising quality event logistics.

To be more precise: all funds go towards essential life expenses, in-house game and live event development costs, high-speed internet, website hosting and promotion as well as turning Cyberhippie HQ into an inspiring space equipped with proper technology to make the community feel at home. 

What do I get?
Becoming a Patron of our tribe gives you multiple benefits depending on the tier chosen.
	•	Receive a special thank you note for enabling something quirky and genuine, which you should read in a remote location for full realism, preferably a peacefully rendered forest or at an actual park depending on the availability (who are we to judge),
	•	Read Patron-only posts and vote on new community features, events and influence our development decisions,
	•	Receive our in-house projects for free as they are released, normally sold for a fair price,
	•	Get online community access, receive priority help, an invite to a hidden channel & exclusive Patron role so you can brag about it to your friends. Oh, and obviously you'll be awarded with a Cyberhippie Badge!
	•	Get credited in all our projects, website or even physically on the wall of Cyberhippie HQ for everyone to see during livestreams,
	•	Receive a one-of-a-kind Cyberhippie Goodie Pack (Coming Soon™) containing digital and physical items proving your tribal flair in form of a Cyberhippie Orientation Booklet, Printed Postcards, Stickers, Pins, Pinecone T-shirt and a unique 3D-printed Pinecone Totem to always carry the spirit of our community with you!

Become a Patron before May 2018 and get the time-limited status of a Founding Tribe Member.

Who are you?
My name is @mothnode or Tim. I'm a multispecialist, promoter, community-builder, hitech creative dabbling in a variety of interactive fields. Explorer of traditional and emergent narration applied and used with creative technology in filmmaking, virtual worlds and digital art.

My path of discovery has been a long one. Over the years I went from my initial background in photography and writing through filmmaking to interactive videoart and finally development of interactiveexperiences. During that time I got to know two things about myself: 

	•	I want to quietly nurture and grow unique worlds for people to experience.
	•	I want to gather like-minded individuals to create communities of learners and educators in the art of virtual interaction.
The result of these interests is visible and resides in form of this project. 
Let me know what you think!

What else do you maintain?
	•	Jobs in Games Poland - fanpage posting fresh game industry job content on my fanpage.
	•	Poszukiwany/Poszukiwana w Projektowaniu Gier (Wanted in Game Design) - game industry jobs group & discussion board.
	•	Weekend Retreat - weekly show on Twitch where we play some interactive gems.


[ ] Declined Pledges Message: Hey friend,
May was crazy but we’re through that now and June and July is going to be awesome and I’m glad we managed to create a connection here.
Which is why I’m wondering how can I serve you the most.
We’ve grown a bit since we’ve first started in terms of our Discord community and we’ve learned a ton about maintaining it, about Patreon and we’re still learning  how to create a compelling experience.
But we have also made our handful of mistakes as well. Thankfully, we have great folks around us who can give us feedback, which is why I’m asking you for yours.
Let me know how we can make you Patreon experience better and how we can earn the right to serve you for another month.
No pressure, of course. Just a simple e-mail from one digital native to another.
Sidenote: if a recurring pledge is not your cup of tea, one time donations are also welcomed via PayPal or Buy Me A Coffee.
Have a fantastic day,
Tim (@mothnode)

[ ] COMMUNITY SPIRIT CHALLENGE (MAY 2018: [leaderboard photo]
Our monthly tradition at Cyberhippie Collective is to reward community engagement and being a kindred spirit. 
Every single time you talk banter or brainstorm with other tribe members on our Discord you gain a random amount of 15 to 25 experience points. Remember, you can only gain experience once per minute (Mee6 bot limit).
At the end of every month we reset the leaderboard and a winner is chosen (mothnode is excluded for obvious reasons).
We don't want to keep you waiting so here's the result for the month of May. Lo and behold, the winner is our tribe member... drumroll
